What you need:
   Proxy for each account you use
   TwitchTV accounts
   An OAUTH token for chat_login

Account List should look like
   username:oauth:oauthtoken (iamthegod:oauth:102391024nrthtgwqtgh)

Proxy list should look like (Out of the box it only supports HTTP proxys, you can change this to socks4 or 5 if you look where it sets the proxy)
   127.0.0.1:5343
   234.66.156.123:55356

Usage
   python2 chatbomber.py
   channel> sirhcez
   message> ay yo sirhcez is gay

Recommended
I recommend making 10-20 accounts manually and generating oauths or using an account creator to do it
Using proxy scrapers for working proxys

You NEED proxys for this or all of your accounts will get banned AUTOMATICALLY. Don't be STUPID then ask me questions about why you can't get this to work.
