=================================

What you need:


1)   Proxy for each account you use

2)   TwitchTV accounts

3)   An OAUTH token for chat_login

=================================

Account List should look like


1)   username:oauth:oauthtoken (iamthegod:oauth:102391024nrthtgwqtgh)

=================================

Proxy list should look like (Out of the box it only supports HTTP proxys, you can change this to socks4 or 5 if you look where it sets the proxy)


1)   127.0.0.1:5343

2)   234.66.156.123:55356

=================================

Usage


1)   python2 chatbomber.py

2)   channel> nightblue3

3)   message> NightBlue is 2sexy4me

=================================

Recommended


1)   I recommend making 10-20 accounts manually and generating oauths or using an account creator to do it

2)   Using proxy scrapers for working proxys

3)   You NEED proxys for this or all of your accounts will get banned AUTOMATICALLY. Don't be STUPID then ask me questions about why you can't get this to work.
